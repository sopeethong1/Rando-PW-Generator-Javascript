# Rando-PW-Generator-Javascript
## Description 
Using Javascript, I modified starter code to create an application that enables users to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.
